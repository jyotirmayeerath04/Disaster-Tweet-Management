# 🌪 *Disaster Tweet Classification using NLP*

This project focuses on classifying tweets to detect whether they are about *real disasters* or *not*, using Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning models.

---

## 🧠 *Objective*

To build a robust text classification pipeline that accurately identifies disaster-related tweets using *CountVectorizer, **TF-IDF*, and regression-based models.

## 📊 *Dataset*

The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle: NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data) competition and includes:

- text: The tweet content  
- target:  
  - 1 → Tweet refers to a disaster  
  - 0 → Tweet does not refer to a disaster

## 📈 *Results*
Comparison between CountVectorizer and TF-IDF for feature extraction

Logistic Regression performed best in classification tasks

Evaluation through confusion matrix and classification report shows promising results

## 🔮 *Future Improvements*
🤖 Integrate transformer models like BERT or RoBERTa

🛠 Add GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
